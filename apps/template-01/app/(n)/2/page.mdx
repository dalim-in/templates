## 5 Portfolio Design Tips to Stand Out as a Designer

<br />

Your portfolio is your voice when you’re not in the room. Here are five design tips to make it speak clearly, confidently, and creatively.

## 1. Tell a story, not just show screenshots

Don’t just drop mockups — walk people through your process.

- What was the problem?
-	What did you contribute?
- How did the design evolve?

Show how you think, not just what you made.

## 2. Design for clarity, not cleverness

Clean beats clever. Use generous white space, readable fonts, and simple navigation.

```js
<h1 className="text-4xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Work</h1>
<p className="text-muted-foreground">Selected projects and case studies</p>
```

If people can’t find your work in 10 seconds, they’ll bounce.

## 3. Show your range, not your whole archive

Curate your work like a gallery. Pick 3–6 strong projects that show:

- Variety (e.g. branding, web, UI)
- Depth (process, iterations)
- Growth (early → polished)

More isn’t better — clarity is.

## 4. Make it personal, not just professional

Your personality matters. Add a short bio, share your interests, or explain why design matters to you.

Let your portfolio feel human — not just a pitch deck.

---

## 5. Optimize for speed and mobile

A beautiful portfolio that loads slowly = bad UX.

Use responsive layouts, compress images, and test it on your phone. It should feel just as smooth on small screens.
