## Work
 
I’m a designer focused on building clean, intuitive interfaces and visual systems. I craft user experiences that feel simple, modern, and functional — while helping brands express themselves clearly. Here’s a summary of the work I’ve done so far.

## Dalim

<Small>Founder & Creative Director</Small>

At Dalim, I lead product design and visual direction across web and brand projects. My goal is to create tools that feel polished and purposeful — blending usability with strong aesthetics.

I design interfaces, build component systems, explore motion, and guide brand identities. I also teach what I learn by sharing resources, writing about process, and mentoring new designers.

## Freelance Work

<Small>Graphic & Web Designer, 2020 – Present</Small>

As a freelance designer, I’ve worked with startups and creators to build logos, design landing pages, and develop design systems. I focus on:

- UI/UX for web apps
- Brand identity and logos
- Social media design
- Design systems and documentation

I love simplifying complex ideas into clear visual stories and making sure the design feels right at every scale — from color palettes to hover states.

## Internships & Early Work

<Small>Junior Designer, 2018 – 2020</Small>

Before going full-time, I explored design through internships and small projects — experimenting with tools like Figma, Illustrator, Photoshop, and Webflow. I built templates, icons, moodboards, and responsive layouts while learning the fundamentals of:

- Typography and grid systems
- Color theory
- Branding and composition
- Design tools and workflows

These early experiences helped me build a strong foundation in visual design and shaped the way I approach creative work today.
